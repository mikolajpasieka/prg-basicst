#A tree may be cut down if its diameter is at least 50 cm. Write a program that, based on the circumference of the tree entered from the keyboard, calculates and prints the value True if the tree can be cut down, or print the value False otherwise. Sample result:
# Enter tree circumference in cm: 120 
# Tree can be cut down: False
# Then, check if the program works correctly. There are several trees in the garden with the given circumferences in cm. Which trees can be cut down?
# Tree 1: 160 Tree 2: 90 Tree 3: 230 Tree 4: 120
import math 
circumference= int(input("Enter tree circumference in cm:")) 
diameter = circumference / (2*math.pi)
cut = diameter >= 50 
print(f'The tree can be cut down: {cut}')
