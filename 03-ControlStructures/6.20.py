#Write a program that converts a decimal number into a binary number. 
# To convert a decimal number to binary, follow these steps:
# Read a decimal number from the keyboard.
# Divide the number by 2 and note the remainder.
# Divide the quotient obtained by 2 and note the remainder.
# Repeat the same process till we get 0 as the quotient.
# Write the values of all the remainders starting from the bottom to the top. That will be the required binary number.
# Sample result:
# Enter decimal number: 12
# 12(10) = 1100(2)
